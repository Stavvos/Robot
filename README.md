# robot
 A program written in python that adds keyboard control for a reaspberry pi robot I made.
 
 The robot is a simple 3-wheeled car. Two of the wheels are powered by dc motors. The third wheel acts
 as a support and steering wheel. 


This program needs to be run from the terminal in order for it to work. Using the commands 'dir', 'cd' and 'python' will help
acheive this. 

There's a bug that happens when the robot is connected to a raspberry pi that has power
supplied to it. A wheel of the robot will spin until this program is exectuted, power is cut-off from
the raspberry pi, or the circuit is broken. I'm not sure why this bug happens. 

when using the program press 'W' to move the robot up, 'S' to move the robot down, 'A' to move the robot left, and 'D' to move
the robot right. Press the 'ENTER/RETURN' key to stop the current command, and press 'Q' to close the program.
